## Explanation of Key Features

- **Task Creation**: This feature allows users to create new tasks by entering essential details such as task name, description, due date, and priority level (high, medium, or low). This ensures that each task is well-organized and easily manageable, enhancing overall productivity.

- **Task List**: The app presents all tasks in a straightforward list view, enabling users to quickly view both completed and pending tasks. Tasks are visually distinguished based on their completion status, allowing for a clear overview of ongoing responsibilities.

- **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as complete with a simple click on the checkbox icon. Completed tasks are visually represented with a strikethrough effect, providing immediate feedback and helping users track their progress effectively.

- **Priority Settings**: Each task can be assigned a priority level, which is visually represented with different text colors. This feature helps users to prioritize their tasks, allowing them to focus on the most important ones first, thereby improving task management.

- **Task Editing**: Users have the flexibility to edit their tasks at any time. They can modify details such as the task name, description, due date, and priority. This feature ensures that users can adapt their task lists to reflect any changes in their plans or circumstances.



- **Persistent Data**: All task data is saved persistently on the userâ€™s device. This means that even if the app is closed, tasks remain saved and accessible. This feature ensures that users do not lose any task information between sessions, making the app reliable for long-term use.
